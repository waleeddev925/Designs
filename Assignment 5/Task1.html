            <pre id="pre4">
    Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, 
    incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and abandoned browsers.

    We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to 
    the tireless efforts of folk like the W3C, WaSP, and the major browser creators.
                
    The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the 
    masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new 
    and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.

There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. 
The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage 
participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs 
in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet 
into this very page. The HTML remains the same, the only 
thing that has changed is the external CSS file. Yes, really.

CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a 
hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated 
in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating 
what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the 
hands of those able to create beauty from structure. 
Designers and coders alike have contributed to the 
beauty of the web; we can always push it further.

        <div class="rightbar">
            <p style="background-color: rgb(231, 65, 65); font-size: 40px; color: white;"> &nbsp &nbsp Participation</p>
            <pre
                style="color: white; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(231, 65, 65) ; line-height: 25px;">
    Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are 
    modifying this page, so strong CSS skills are necessary 
    too, but the example files are commented well enough 
    that even CSS novices can use them as starting points. 
    Please see the CSS Resource Guide for advanced 
    tutorials and tips on working with CSS.

    You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but 
    not the HTML. This may seem daunting at first if you've 
    never worked this way before, but follow the listed links 
    to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.

    Download the sample HTML and CSS to work on a copy 
    locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece 
    (and please, don’t submit half-finished work) upload 
    your CSS file to a web server under your control. Send 
    us a link to an archive of that file and all associated 
    assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it 
    and place it on our server.
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="rightbar2">
            <p style="font-size: 30px; background-color: white;" ><br>  &nbsp &nbsp Requirements</p>
            <pre style="background-color: white; font-size: 16px; word-spacing: -2px; line-height: 25px;">
    Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 & 2 usage. CSS 3 & 4 should be 
    limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. 
    The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical CSS and not the latest bleeding-
    edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we 
    have is that your CSS validates.

    Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented CSS 
    by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results 
    across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web 
    these days — especially when you factor in mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may not 
    be possible across every platform. That’s okay, but do test in as many as you can. 
    Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and 
    Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).
                
    We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep 
    objectionable material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting 
    visual themes to your work. We’re well past the point of needing another garden-
    related design.
                
    This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on 
    your graphics (with limited exceptions, see submission guidelines), but we ask you 
    release your CSS under a Creative Commons license identical to the one on this site 
    so that others may learn from your work.
