       <b> The Road to Enlightenment </b>

        Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags,
        incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and abandoned browsers.

        We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved
        thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the W3C, WaSP, and the major 
        browser creators.

            The CSS Zen Garden invites you to 
            relax and meditate on the 
            important lessons of the masters. 
            Begin to see with clarity. 
            Learn to use the time-honored techniques 
            in new and invigorating fashion. 
            Become one with the web.

There is a continuing need to show the 
power of CSS. The Zen Garden aims to 
excite, inspire, and encourage participation. 
To begin, view some of the existing designs 
in the list. Clicking on any one will load the 
style sheet into this very page. The HTML 
remains the same, the only thing that has 
changed is the external CSS file. Yes, really.

CSS allows complete and total control over 
the style of a hypertext document. The only 
way this can be illustrated in a way that gets
people excited is by demonstrating what it 
can truly be, once the reins are placed in the 
hands of those able to create beauty from 
structure. Designers and coders alike have 
contributed to the beauty of the web; 
we can always push it further.
